            In the beginning ...<br>
            This is not a creation story. Or wait, is it?<br>
            It is actually the beginning of something new. Creating something new. Something you can proudly claim as yours.
            To achieve our dreams we need to start from somewhere. There must be a beginning to that wonderful future you always 
            fantasize about. "A journey of thosand miles begines with a single step.(source here)" That step maybe your limit or a stepping 
            stone to greater heights. But the most important question is, are you ready and willing to take that step?
            <br>
            How then do you begin?<br>
            You may have realised that I didn't attribute the quote in my heading to anyone. This because I found out it had been credited 
            to two people (Arthur Ashe and Theodore Roosevelt). This quote is one of my favourite and also helped me answer that one 
            question, where do I start?<br>
            From the Biblical story of Moses, God asked him, "What do you have in your hand?" At that moment Moses was consentrating on his 
            flaws and shortcomings. He wasn't planning to be a leader, an advocate for freedom, or a role model. He may have been content 
            with his position as a sherpherd in a foreign land. I have felt this way so many times and I guess you have also been in such 
            situation.<br>
            Starting something new is NOT easy. Day in day out people come out with brilliant ideas to do something new. These ideas may 
            come about through dreams, experiences, movies, friends and family, relaxing in a bath tub or having an apple fall on your head.
            So how do you get that fantastic idea to work? Where do you start? What do you need to start? You shouldn't think far or don't 
            think at all. Just do it.
